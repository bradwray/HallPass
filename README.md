# HallPass
A hallpass for my students. 

Dear teachers, 

To use this hallpass just append your last name to the URL... 

For example if your last name is smith https://q7ll6nmxl9.codesandbox.io/Smith/

Then turn that into a QR code, print it with some instructions and post it near your desk.

If students have to go to the bathroom I just point at the QR code. It makes a unique pass for them that will expire after 7 minutes. It saves that time to their device and they cannot refresh it to get more time. 

I hope it works for you.
